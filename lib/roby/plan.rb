    # A plan object manages a collection of tasks and events.
    #
    # == Adding and removing objects from plans
    # The #add, #add_mission and #add_permanent calls allow to add objects in
    # plans. The #remove_object removes the same objects from the plan. Note
    # that you should never remove objects yourself: a GC mechanism will do
    # that properly for you, taking into account the consequences of the object
    # removal.
    #
    # To reduce the complexity of object management, a garbage collection
    # mechanism is in place during the plan execution, stopping and removing
    # tasks that are not useful anymore for the system's goals. This garbage
    # collection mechanism runs at the end of the execution cycle. Once an
    # object is not active (i.e. for a task, once it is stopped), the object is
    # /finalized/ and either the #finalized_task or the #finalized_event hook is
    # called.
    #
    # Two special kinds of objects exist in plans:
    # * the +missions+ (#missions, #mission?, #add_mission and #unmark_mission) are the
    #   final goals of the system.  A task is +useful+ if it helps into the
    #   Realization of a mission (it is the child of a mission through one of the
    #   task relations).
    # * the +permanent+ objects (#add_permanent, #unmark_permanent, #permanent?, #permanent_tasks and
    #   #permanent_events) are plan objects that are not affected by the plan's
    #   garbage collection mechanism. As for missions, task that are useful to
    #   permanent tasks are also
