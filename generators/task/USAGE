Generates a new empty task class (subclass of Roby::Task) and associated test
file. It must be given the new class name either in CamelCase or snake_case
form. Namespaces can also be given, either in/this/form or In::This::Form.

If a robot name is specified with the -r option, the files will be created in
this robot's specific folders

Example: running the following command in a rock_auv app
  roby gen control/job

  will generate a RockAuv::Control::Job class in models/tasks/control/job.rb as
  well as the associated test file in test/tasks/control/test_job.rb
