Generates a new empty action interface class (subclass of
Roby::Actions::Interface) and associated test file. It must
be given the new class name either in CamelCase or snake_case
form. Namespaces can also be given, either in/this/form or
In::This::Form.

If a robot name is specified with the -r option, the files will be created in
this robot's specific folders

Example: running the following command in a rock_auv app
  roby gen actions manipulation/grasping

  will generate a RockAuv::Manipulation::Grasping class in
  models/actions/manipulation/grasping.rb as well as the
  associated test file in test/actions/manipulation/test_grasping.rb
